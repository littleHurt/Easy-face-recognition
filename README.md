# Easy-face-recognition
This is a simple example of face detection and recognition by MTCNN and Google FaceNet algorithm.

The codes are mainly refered from this repo: https://github.com/Practical-AI/Face

You can get the pre-trained model of face-net from here: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12aMYASGCKvDdkygSv1yQq8ns03AStDO_

And the MTCNN library used in this example is this: https://pypi.org/project/mtcnn/

Tested environment was described as below:

	MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015);
	CPU 2.7 GHz dual-core, Intel Core i5;
	RAM 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3;
	Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB;
	Python 3.7.9 (Spyder 4.1.5 from Anaconda);
