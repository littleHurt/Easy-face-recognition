# Easy-face-recognition
* This is a simple example of face detection and recognition by MTCNN and Google FaceNet algorithm. 
* The codes are mainly refered from this repo: [Practical-AI/Face](https://github.com/Practical-AI/Face)
* You can get the pre-trained model of FaceNet from this [google drive folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/12aMYASGCKvDdkygSv1yQq8ns03AStDO_)
* And the MTCNN library used in this example is from this page: [mtcnn Â· PyPI](https://pypi.org/project/mtcnn/)

#### Tested environment was described as below: <h4>
	* MacBook Pro (Retina, 13-inch, Early 2015);
	* CPU 2.7 GHz dual-core, Intel Core i5;
	* RAM 16 GB 1867 MHz DDR3;
	* Intel Iris Graphics 6100 1536 MB;
	* Python 3.7.9 (Spyder 4.1.5 from Anaconda)
